# KNN-Model
Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project is a beginner-friendly data science exploration where I use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flower species from the classic Iris dataset. The dataset is built into many Python libraries and is a common starting point for learning machine learning fundamentals.

🔍 What this project includes

Loading and understanding the built-in Iris dataset

Data exploration and basic visualization

Splitting the data into training and testing sets

Training a KNN classifier

Evaluating model performance (accuracy score + confusion matrix)

Simple, easy-to-read code ideal for beginners

Insights gained during my learning journey

Comments explaining each step for clarity

🎯 Purpose of the Project

I recently completed a 2-month data science short course, and this project is part of my learning practice. It showcases my understanding of:

Basic machine learning workflows

Supervised learning

Python data science libraries (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

scikit-learn

pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

🚀 Future Enhancements

Try different ML algorithms (SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)

Parameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Enhanced visualizations

Deploying the model using Streamlit
